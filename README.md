### 🧐 What is this?

A tiny browser app experienced through a **Kinetic UI** that:
- 🎤 **Listens** to nearby audio
- ⏳ **Plays it back** after ~2 seconds
- 😵 **Creates instant confusion**
- 🛑 **Accidentally makes people stop talking**

No ML. No backend. No responsibility.
Just **Web Audio API**, vibes, and an **LLM**.

### ⚡ Features

- **Raw Audio Feed**: Disabled all noise suppression for maximum feedback chaos.
- **Demon Mode**: A 50Hz Ring Modulator effect to make you sound like a Dalek.
- **Dark Mode**: Brutalist aesthetics. dark-matte background.

### 🧠 Why does this work? (probably)

Something something:
- [x] Delayed Auditory Feedback (DAF)
- [x] Cognitive Dissonance
- [x] Humans hate hearing themselves 200ms late

I’m not a neuroscientist. All I know is it *works*.
